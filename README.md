Mitsogo Website Project:-

This project is a fully responsive website developed using React.js, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website features a responsive navbar, header section, features section, slider, automatic slider, customer opinions, and more. Additionally, I have implemented animations on scroll (AOS) and a "Scroll to Top" button for enhanced user experience.

Technologies Used:-

Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap
Packages: React Icons, AOS (Animate on Scroll)

Setup Instructions:-

1.Clone the repository:
2.git clone <repository-url>
3.cd <project-directory>
4.Install dependencies: Use the following command to install the required npm packages:

In terminal:-
5.npm install

Run the project: Start the development server with:

1.npm start
Open your browser: Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the website.


Bonus Features:

AOS (Animate on Scroll): I integrated the AOS package to add engaging animations as users scroll down the page. This feature enhances the overall visual appeal and encourages interaction.
Scroll to Top Button: Although this feature was not part of the original task, I implemented a "Scroll to Top" button to improve navigation, allowing users to easily return to the top of the page.


During the development process, I encountered some challenges:

Implementing animations and functionalities required careful planning and testing, which took some time to overcome.
I faced difficulties in obtaining certain images from the task website's inspection tool, which led to some delays.
Overall, this project was a rewarding challenge that enhanced my skills in web development, and I am proud of the final outcome.








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
